## Introduction

This is the repository for the code for the integrated modelling example for Isaac et al. (submitted), fitting a model for the black-throated blue warbler (_Setophaga caerulescens_) in Pennsylvania, USA. This is an extension of the analysis in @Miller2019. 

We use the following observation data:

-  Pennsylvania Breeding Bird Atlas point count data for part of Pennsylvania. This is taken straight from [the SI](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1111%2F2041-210X.13110&file=mee313110-sup-0001-supplementA.zip) of @Miller2019
- eBird data from 2006-2009, downloaded from GBIF, using the spocc package [@Spocc]
- North American BBS data [@NABBS] for 2005-2009

These data are in the Data directory.

For environmental data we use elevation and canopy cover, both imported directly into R.

- Elevation is imported using the elevatr package which utilises Amazon Web Services terrain tiles [@elevatr]
- Canopy cover is imported using the FedData package which downloads the USGS's NLCD canopy data from 2011 [@FedData]

## Workflow

The workflow is as follows:

- extract the observation data, with [ExtractData.R](ExtractData.R). This has already been done, and the results are the .csv files in Data/
- make the INLA stacks, using [MakeStacks.R](MakeStacks.R). This includes the covariate data, and creates some large objects that we don't save in this repository.
- Fit the model, with [FitWarblerModel.R](FitWarblerModel.R). This takes some time (overnight?), and creates another big .RData file.
- Look at and plot the results, with [WarblerResults.R](WarblerResults.R). This produces some maps

Functions Folder

Some of these functions are from the current version of the PointedSDms package. As that package is in early development, we cannot guarantee the functions will be the same when you read this.
